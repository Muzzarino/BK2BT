# BK2BT
This program is in an early alpha stage and can currently:
*Preview Banjo-Kazooie model bin files (Both Opaque and Alpha models at once)
*Convert said bin files to work in Banjo-Tooie (F3DEX microcode to F3DEX2)

Upcoming plans:
*Allow preview of Banjo-Tooie model files (Must have ROM opened for texture streaming)
*Convert BT Bin files to BK Bin files
*(Maybe) Allow model editing such as vertex RGBA painting
