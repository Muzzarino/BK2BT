BK2BT currently is in an early alpha stage can currently:
-Preview Banjo-Kazooie model bin files (Both Opaque and Alpha models at once)
-Convert said bin files to work in Banjo-Tooie (F3DEX microcode to F3DEX2)

Upcoming plans:
-Allow preview of Banjo-Tooie model files (Must have ROM opened for texture streaming)
-Convert BT Bin files to BK Bin files
-(Maybe) Allow model editing such as vertex RGBA painting
